## Project Summary
American Urban Legends was created to learn Redux and React Router for the first time. The original American Urban legneds application was a static website. The code you see here was redesigned to be a more dynamic application through the use of React, JavaScript, Redux and React Router. Additionally it has been created to be responsive with all browser sizes, including mobile devices, and features advanced functionality and improved user experience.

### What I learned
In this project, I honed my skills in React Router by implementing dynamic routing and direct linking to anchors, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient website with reduced code. I also discovered how to leverage passed-in data objects to create multiple pages within the website, allowing me to simulate distinct pages using a single function instead of manually creating pages for each region and story.
