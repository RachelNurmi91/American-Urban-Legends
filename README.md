## Project Summary
This project was created to help further under React and Redux. American Urban legneds is a recreated a website using React, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and React Router. I transformed an outdated static website into a dynamic, interactive website. The new website is optimized for all browser sizes, including mobile devices, and features advanced functionality and improved user experience. 

### Built with
- React
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap

### What I learned
In this project, I honed my skills in React Router by implementing dynamic routing and direct linking to anchors, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient website with reduced code. I also discovered how to leverage passed-in data objects to create multiple pages within the website, allowing me to simulate distinct pages using a single function instead of manually creating pages for each region and story.
